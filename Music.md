<h2 id="heading2">Playing Music</h2>
<p>Another one of my hobbies is music, in particular, I like to play the trombone. I have been playing for over four years now and have had some great oppurtunitites to learn a lot from other musicians. I am currently in WPI's concert band, orchestra, brass ensemble, and pep band.</p>

<h2 id="heading2">Listening to music</h2>
<p>I listen to <b>a lot</b> of classic rock. Some of favorite bands include Led Zeppelin, Boston, The Who, ACDC, and The Beatles. </p>
