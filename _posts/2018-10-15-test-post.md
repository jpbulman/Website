<figcaption>Boston, MA</figcaption>
<p>This is the launch of my personal website!</p>

<p> I'm hoping to put information about myself here so that anyone who wants to learn more about my work, they can. This is the first post I've added, all of the previous ones came with the website. I'm keeping them for now, I guess, just in case I want to refrence the tools later on. Most of the pictures or covers I have added are from <a href="https://pixabay.com" target="_blank">pixabay</a>, unless otherwise noted. The theme I am using is from <a href="http://jekyllthemes.org/themes/hanuman/" target="_blank">jekyllthemes</a>. The Git repo for this site will be public shortly, and I will add that when it is. In the meantime, feel free to check out the rest of the material on here, and <a href="/contact" target="_blank">reach out</a> to me if you have any questions!</p>
