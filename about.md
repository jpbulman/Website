My name is JP Bulman, I am a sophmore at WPI majoring in computer science. I am fluent in Java, Python, C++, C, and know a decent amount about web programming. Feel free to check out my <a href="https://github.com/jpbulman">GitHub profile</a> to see some of the projects I have worked on. My favorite pastimes are to play trombone and speedsolve Rubik's Cubes. You can learn about all of these more specifically in the tabs over to the left of this page.
